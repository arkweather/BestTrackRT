# Best Track Real Time

Best Track: Real Time (BTRT) is a Python package designed to read in the output of a third-party storm identification and tracking algorithm (i.e. WDSS-II segmotion; ProbSevere) and improve upon that algorithm’s tracking by correcting unjustifiable breaks in an object’s track.  BTRT is loosely modeled after the WDSS-II besttrack algorithm, but modified to support real-time processing of an operational model’s output.  For full usage instructions as well as algorithm theory, please see the PDF under ./Documentation.
